# Media 470 project IntelliAgents


With IntelliAgents, we want to experiment with advanced agentic workflows to streamline and automate complex tasks. Our current use case is the automatic generation of calendar events based on a syllabus upload. By utilizing agentic agents, IntelliAgents ensures that all relevant dates and deadlines are seamlessly integrated into your calendar, enhancing productivity and organization.
